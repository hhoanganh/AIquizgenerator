Circumstance: You are a Senior Business Analyst at an IT company. The company is working on a project with a client to develop an application for the banking industry. During the development process, the team has identified some changes that need to be made to the original specifications. Your manager has tasked you with assessing the risks associated with making these changes and coming up with a plan for how they should be managed.
Q: What steps should you take when managing change in this type of situation?
A1: Make sure stakeholders are aware of the proposed changes and their potential impact on existing processes 
A2: Gather feedback from all relevant stakeholders  
A3: Develop an implementation plan of action based on risk assessments 
Correct: 3 
Explanation: In order to effectively manage proposed changes, it is important to first determine what type of risks may result from implementing them. This can be done by conducting risk assessments which involve gathering feedback from all relevant stakeholders in order to identify areas where additional research or analysis may be needed, as well as any potential impacts that could arise due to making adjustments or amendments. Once this information is collected, it can then be used to develop an implementation plan of action that considers these risks and outlines how they should be addressed accordingly. 
Example: For example, if there is concern about how changing one part of the application code might affect another existing feature, then this issue should first be assessed by conducting research into any potential impacts or side effects that could arise after making such a change. Once fully investigated, appropriate measures can then be taken specific to mitigating any identified risks before finally considering whether or not it would still make sense for your team proceed in implementing these modifications into their final product delivery.
