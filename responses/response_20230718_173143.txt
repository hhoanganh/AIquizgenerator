Q: What are some key steps in stakeholder management?
A1: Identifying stakeholders early on in the project. 
A2: Establishing ground rules for communication between stakeholders. 
A3: Creating an open dialogue between stakeholders and project team members. 
Correct: 1  
Explanation: It's important that stakeholders are identified early on in order to create effective engagement strategies throughout the life cycle of a project or initiative. This includes ensuring that their interests, needs, expectations, roles and responsibilities are taken into account when making decisions about how resources will be allocated or managed over time. Establishing ground rules for communication between stakeholders is also essential for successful stakeholder management as it ensures everyone understands what kind of information should be shared and how it should be shared (e.g., via email versus face-to-face meetings). Having an open dialogue between stakeholders and project team members allows for feedback from both sides which can help inform decision making as well as ensure that progress is being made towards achieving goals/objectives set out at the start of a project or initiative.  
Example: Consider an example where you have been tasked with developing a mobile app for a client company’s product launch event coming up soon within 4 weeks’ time frame; each week there would need to be online conference calls setup with specified key areas to review overall progress on design & development including user experience testing & other validations against final product deliverables planned by end of 4th week; such routine engagements with all relevant internal & external parties engaged would help keep momentum sustained while taking into consideration any changes required along journey if needed – thereby effectively managing stakeholder(s) expectations upfront without surprises towards delivery date!
