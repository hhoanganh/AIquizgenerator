Circumstance: You are a business analyst working with a team of developers to create an application for a new client. The project was originally planned to take 3 months, but you recently found out that the timeline has been shortened by one month. You have already discussed the change with the development team and they agreed to make it work. Now, you need to discuss the changes with other stakeholders in order to get their approval as well. 
Q: What is the best approach for making sure that all stakeholders are informed about and agree on the changes in timelines? 
A1: Draft a document outlining all of the changes, explain why they are necessary, and send it out for review from each stakeholder. 
A2: Have quick meetings with each stakeholder individually and inform them of all proposed changes quickly before beginning work on any tasks. 
A3: Send out an email summarizing entire project timeline changes along with reasons why these changes are necessary without holding any individual meetings or following up afterwards. 
Correct: 1  
Explanation: Sending out a document outlining all of the proposed timeline changes is important because it allows each stakeholder time to review what is being proposed before coming to a final decision. Having quick meetings can also be beneficial so that matters can be discussed further if needed; however, sending out an email summarizing all of the proposed timeline without any follow-up may not allow enough time for stakeholders to fully consider what is being asked from them or provide adequate explanations as needed.  
Example: For instance, if there were questions about certain timeline adjustments due to resource availability issues, having multiple individual conversations could provide more details than simply sending an email explaining such concerns without providing evidence or elaboration about how those decisions were made upfront in order for stakeholders involved feel comfortable agreeing ahead of time.
