Circumstance: John is a Junior IT Business Analyst working on developing a new system for an insurance company. He was tasked with designing the flow of customer data from the existing legacy system to the new system, and he had hoped that this would be relatively straightforward. However, when he began analyzing the process, he quickly realized there were several steps that could not be automated and thus must be performed manually by employees. 
Q: What is one possible way to reduce manual processes in order to improve efficiency? 
A1: Automate as much of the processes as possible. 
A2: Implement AI technology into existing systems.  
A3: Outsource certain tasks to third parties or freelancers. 
Correct: 1 
Explanation: Automating as many processes as possible reduces manual labor which leads to improved efficiency since computers can perform these tasks faster than humans and without needing breaks or rest days in between task execution cycles. AI technologies cannot fully replace manual labor but rather assist in automating specific functions while outsourcing entirely removes some elements of work away from a business's staff reducing overhead costs associated with managing personnel resources such as salaries, benefits, etc., however it may also lead to increased risks associated with entrusting sensitive information over external sources thereby introducing vulnerabilities into corporate security architecture if proper measures are not taken while outsourcing projects or services to third parties/freelancers..  
Example : For example, John could use software automation tools (such as Task Scheduler) coupled with pre-defined rulesets (scripts) written using various programming languages (e.g., Python) for automatically triggering certain actions depending on predefined conditions leading up until those points where human intervention becomes necessary either due to complexity of task at hand or simply lack of appropriate digital resources available internally within organization’s infrastructure for performing those particular jobs/tasks efficiently and reliably enough so they no longer need extra attention from experienced personnel such us junior IT BAs
