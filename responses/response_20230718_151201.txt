Category: Change Management and Impact Analysis 
Circumstance: A company is going through a change process to adopt Agile methodologies. They have hired an experienced Business Analyst to assess the impact of this change on their current operations in order to ensure that it goes smoothly. 
Q: What must the Business Analyst do before making any recommendations regarding the change process? 
A1: Analyze the organization's existing processes and systems, looking for areas of improvement or potential conflicts with new systems/processes. 
A2: Create a comprehensive stakeholder analysis including identifying resistance points and key influencers of acceptance.
A3: Estimate budget requirements for implementing changes, researching different vendors and products if necessary.
Correct: 1 
Explanation: The first answer is most correct because prior to making any type of recommendation about a change process, it is important for a business analyst to conduct an analysis of existing processes within the organization as well as relevant system information in order to identify areas which need improvement or could potentially conflict with new systems/processes that will be implemented by adopting Agile methodologies. This step should come before creating stakeholder analysis or estimating budget requirements so those tasks can be approached informed by what was uncovered during the initial data collection phase.  
Example: To successfully implement Agile methodologies into an organization, it is essential that its current processes are analyzed beforehand in order to identify conflicting elements and determine where improvements can be made. For example, if an existing system has been heavily customized over time due to changing needs but no documentation has been kept up-to-date throughout these changes then this could create complications when implementing a more standardised approach such as Agile development which relies on regular review cycles from stakeholders at all levels within management structures across departments etc..
