Category: Data Modeling and Database Design
Circumstance: Your team is working on a project that requires the data to be modeled and stored in a database. The project deadline is nearing, and you need to choose the most efficient way of storing the data while ensuring accuracy and scalability of the database. 
Q: What would be the best way to store data for this project? 
A1: Storing all data in one table. 
A2: Data normalization by breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables.
A3: Using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB or Cassandra. 
Correct: 2
Explanation: Option A1 is not suitable because it will result in having too many columns in one table which can lead to redundant or duplicate information being stored. This will make querying and accessing data difficult since there will be an excessive number of columns that need to be dealt with. Option A2 is more suitable because it involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables which makes querying easier as fewer columns are involved for each query operation as well as reducing redundant/duplicate information from being stored thus making it more efficient overall compared to option A1. Option A3 can also work if dealing with very large datasets such as big-data but this may not always be applicable depending on what type of dataset needs to be stored so option A2 would still remain preferable over option A3 in terms of efficiency when dealing with average datasets that don’t involve lots of big-data analysis operations where using NoSQL databases may be justified for better optimization purposes.  
Example: For example, if you had a table containing customer details you could have multiple tables broken down by demographics (age range), location (city/country) etc which would make queries faster as only certain relevant columns need to be accessed instead of searching through an entire customer details table with many columns which could take longer time when selecting only certain customers based on given parameters such as age range or country they live in etc..
