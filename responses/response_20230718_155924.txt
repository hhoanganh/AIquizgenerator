Category: Requirements Gathering and Documentation
Circumstance: You are a Business Analyst in an IT company that works on developing software applications for their clients. Your team has been assigned a new project to develop a customer loyalty program for an ecommerce store. As the Business Analyst, you need to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders in order to create an effective solution that meets all of their needs. 
Q: What strategy should be used when gathering requirements? 
A1: Conduct interviews with stakeholders 
A2: Observe user behavior while using existing products or services 
A3: Analyze competitive products and features  
Correct: 1 
Explanation: Gathering requirements is one of the most important tasks for business analysts as it allows them to understand stakeholder needs and define product/service features accordingly. The best way to collect this information is through conducting interviews with stakeholders, such as customers, managers, developers etc., who have direct knowledge about the problem and better understanding of what is needed in order to achieve success. Other methods such as observing user behaviour while using existing products or services, analyzing competitive products and features can also provide useful insights but shouldn’t be used instead of interviewing key stakeholders since they may not be able to capture all details required by the application under development.

Example : When working on developing software applications for clients, your team should always use stakeholder interviews as part of their requirement gathering process in order to gain all necessary insight into what exactly needs to be built according how it will help address each individual's need within the organization or industry at hand.
