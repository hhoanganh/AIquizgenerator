Circumstance: Rebecca is a Business Analyst working for an Energy company. Recently, the company has been struggling with inefficient energy supply and inadequate distribution of resources. After analyzing the market trends, they have come up with two potential solutions to address the issue. The first option involves investing in new technologies that would provide more efficient energy production while the second one requires expanding their current distribution network by partnering with smaller companies in other regions. Both solutions are costly but will have a significant impact on their business operations if successful. However, there is no guarantee which approach will be most beneficial for them in the long run so Rebecca needs to make an informed decision on how to proceed.
Q: What should Rebecca consider when making her decision? 
A1: The cost of each solution 
A2: Comparative data from similar projects used by rival companies  
A3: Long-term effects within their industry  
Correct: 3 
Explanation: It is important for Rebecca to consider all aspects of her options before selecting one since this could potentially determine the future success or failure of her company's operations. Option 1 focuses primarily on cost savings while Option 2 could lead to competitive advantages over rival companies if executed properly; however, neither can be accurately evaluated without considering long-term effects such as customer loyalty and brand reputation within their respective industries that may arise due to either choice made by Rebecca’s team at this crucial moment in time..   
Example : To ensure she makes an informed decision, Rebecca should evaluate both solutions' long-term implications such as potential customer loyalty growth if they choose Option 1 (investing in new technologies) versus a possible increase in market share if they go ahead with option 2 (expanding through partnerships).
