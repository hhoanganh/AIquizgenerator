Jane has been assigned to lead a project that will involve extensive stakeholder engagement from multiple departments and external vendors.

A1: Establish clear expectations with each stakeholder in terms of their roles and responsibilities.
A2: Meet regularly with key stakeholders to discuss progress, address issues, and solicit feedback.
A3: Develop professional relationships with stakeholders through communication and collaboration.
Correct: 3 
Explanation: Establishing clear expectations helps set the tone for each stakeholder's role in the project, while regular meetings help ensure that progress is being made towards achieving objectives. Additionally, developing strong relationships through communication and collaboration builds trust between all parties involved in the project which increases motivation as well as encourages open dialogue about challenges or issues that may arise during implementation or execution stages of the project. 
Example: To build productive professional relationships with stakeholders involved in her current project at ABC Corporation, Jane could start by scheduling regular check-ins with them to provide updates on progress made so far - this can be done via email or video calls - as well as opening up opportunities for discussion regarding any potential obstacles or areas of concern they might have related to their involvement in the project. She should also be sure to thank them often for their contributions towards successful completion of tasks on time; this shows appreciation for their efforts which fosters positive working relationships between all parties involved throughout the duration of the project timeline.
