Circumstance: Your company has been given the task to develop a new software solution for an existing client. The client is expecting you to deliver a product which meets their specific needs. As the lead Business Analyst, it is your responsibility to ensure that all stakeholders involved in the project are adequately engaged throughout its entire life-cycle. 
Q: What should be done on an ongoing basis in order to maintain good relationships with the stakeholders?
A1: Regularly meet with each stakeholder individually.
A2: Set up regular status meetings where all stakeholders are invited. 
A3: Give each stakeholder adequate time and attention when discussing any issue or request they might have. 
Correct: 3 
Explanation: Establishing good relationships with all stakeholders is essential for delivering successful projects as it helps ensure everyone involved understands their role and expectations clearly, owns their responsibilities, collaborates effectively, resolves conflicts timely, and proactively communicates issues if detected. This can be achieved by giving each stakeholder adequate time and attention when discussing any issue or request they might have and setting up regular status meetings where all stakeholders are invited so that everyone’s concerns/issues can be addressed together in one place at once without having multiple individual conversations every day/week which wastes time and energy from both parties (the BA & the Stakeholders). 
Example : When meeting with a particular stakeholder about a certain requirement for example - Let them talk first about what they need before jumping into problem solving decisions or asking questions; this will help build understanding of why they need what they asked for since most requirements come out as "I need X" but not necessarily know why X needs to happen - listening carefully allows one to ask better questions later on which results in more accurate solutions being established which meets everyone's expectations.
