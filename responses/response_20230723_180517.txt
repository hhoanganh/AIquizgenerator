Category: Agile Methodologies
Circumstance: You are a senior business analyst for a software development company. The organization has been using the traditional waterfall approach to software development for many years, but now they have decided to adopt an agile methodology as well. As part of the transition process, you have been asked to create and present an educational training session on scrum and kanban for the team members of your project. 
Q: What is the most important difference between Scrum and Kanban?
A1: Scrum follows short sprints while Kanban works in continuous flow.
A2: Scrum focuses on collaboration while Kanban focuses on visibility. 
A3: In Kanban there is no planning phase while it is mandatory in Scrum.  
Correct: 1 
Explanation: The core difference between these two approaches is that Scrum emphasizes short sprints or iterations with predetermined length while Kanban works in a continuous flow without any predefined timeline or activities involved in each iteration or cycle (known as ‘infinite work-in-progress’). Furthermore, Scrum also focuses more on collaboration and communication among team members through daily meetings (known as “Scrums”) whereas Kanban pays more attention to workflows and processes through tracking tools such as dashboards which provides maximum visibility into all tasks related to a project at all times. Lastly, although both approaches encourage regular planning sessions during their respective cycles, it is not mandatory in Kanban like it is in Scrum since its focus lies more towards eliminating bottlenecks by optimizing existing processes instead of introducing new ones at every cycle/iteration stage. 
Example: For example, if you use scrum methodology for product development then it involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller chunks of work that can be completed within certain timeframes or sprints which will eventually lead up to achieving overall goal(s) set by the client(s). Whereas if using kanaban methodology then tasks would be continuously flowing from one step to another without them being divided into sprints but still achieving overall goal(s) set by client(s).
