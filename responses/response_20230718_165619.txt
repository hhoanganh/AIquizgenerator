Circumstance: You are a Junior Business Analyst for an e-commerce company that is looking to improve the customer experience on their website. One of your tasks is to analyze user behavior data and identify areas where improvements can be made. 
Q: How would you go about analyzing user behavior data in order to identify potential improvement areas? 
A1: Use statistical modeling techniques such as regression analysis or clustering algorithms to interpret trends in the data, then develop hypotheses regarding potential improvement options.  
A2: Create surveys that ask users questions about their experiences with the website and use the responses to inform decisions about what changes need to be made. 
A3: Review customer service logs and feedback from customers directly impacted by any issues they experienced while using the site.   
Correct: 1 
Explanation: Statistical modeling allows you to assess large amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing insights into patterns within the data without requiring manual review or extensive survey creation/data sampling efforts. It also provides a more objective view into possible improvement areas than soliciting individual opinions through surveys or feedback could provide alone.  
Example: A Junior Business Analyst might use logistic regression analysis to determine which factors contribute most significantly towards overall customer satisfaction with a website, allowing them to focus on improving those specific components first before moving onto other areas needing attention.
