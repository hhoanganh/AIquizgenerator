Category: User Interface Design
Circumstance: You are a Junior Business Analyst working for a software company. You are tasked with developing a user interface for an application developed for the customers of the company. You have been given some design specifications, but you need to make sure that they meet the customer's needs and expectations. 
Q: Which design technique should be used when developing user interfaces?
A1: The waterfall method
A2: Mockup prototyping 
A3: Testing different design options 
Correct: 2 
Explanation: The waterfall method is a software development approach which involves breaking down large projects into smaller tasks and then proceeding sequentially through each one. This might not be suitable when designing user interfaces as it does not provide enough flexibility or adaptability to changes in requirements or feedback from users. Mockup prototyping involves creating static versions of interactive screens using tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Sketch which can facilitate quick iterations of ideas. This technique allows designers to receive feedback early on and get a better sense of how their designs will look and feel before any code is written. Testing different design options requires implementing multiple versions of the same interface in order to compare outcomes such as usability, performance, etc., over time in order to optimize the final version that gets released.  
Example: If you were designing an app for booking flights, you would create mockups of each page within the app using a tool like Adobe Photoshop or Sketch, allowing you to manipulate elements on each page without having to write any code yet. From this point on, once feedback is received from friends, family members or colleagues who tested your prototype - either through online testing platforms or simply getting them together around one screen - changes can quickly be made based on their input until satisfaction is achieved with the final version being released in its full capacity later on.
