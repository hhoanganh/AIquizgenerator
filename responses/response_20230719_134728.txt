Q: What are two key components of change management that should be considered before implementing any changes within an organization?
A1: Developing an in-depth understanding of organizational culture 
A2: Identifying existing workforce capabilities 
A3: Researching industry trends and competitor strategies 
Correct: 1  
Explanation: Change management consists of identifying existing workforce capabilities and developing an in-depth understanding of organizational culture as these are essential for successful implementation of changes within the organization. Researching industry trends and competitor strategies while important may be irrelevant when making decisions on internal projects or initiatives.  
Example: Prior to introducing any new projects or initiatives, it's critical for organizations to understand their employees' skillsets so that they can properly assign tasks and responsibilities during change implementations. Additionally, organizations need to understand if there are certain cultural norms or conventions that need to be taken into account prior to making drastic changes which could have unexpected effects down the line.
