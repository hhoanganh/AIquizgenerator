Circumstance: You are a Senior Business Analyst for a large international software company with multiple offices around the world. You have been tasked with assessing the potential value of entering a new international market as part of your company’s long-term growth strategy. Your team has identified several countries that could be viable options, but there is limited data on the potential opportunities and risks associated with each one. 
Q: What should you do first to assess the viability of a new international market? 
A1: Assess economic indicators such as GDP, inflation rate, and exchange rates.
A2: Create an internal task force to conduct research and identify key stakeholders in the market.
A3: Establish relationships with local businesses in order to gain insights into customer preferences and trends in the region.
Correct: 3 
Explanation: To properly assess the viability of any given international market, it is important to first establish relationships with local businesses in order to gain an understanding of customer preferences, trends in purchasing behavior, cultural norms, regulations affecting foreign investment or trade agreements, competition within the marketplace etc., before making any decisions on whether or not to enter it. Economic indicators such as GDP or inflation may provide some contextual information on macroeconomic conditions but won't reveal important information about local business practices or customer needs which can help inform decisions more accurately. Creating an internal task force will also be necessary at some point but should only be done after gaining initial insights from interactions with local businesses first.  
Example: For example if you were considering entering into India's market then reaching out to Indian companies who have experience operating successfully within their own country would enable you to get reliable insights into their culture and consumer habits which would allow you make more informed decisions regarding your entry into this particular market than relying solely upon macroeconomic indicators alone.
