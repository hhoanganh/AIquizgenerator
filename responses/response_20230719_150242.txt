A1: Surveys 
A2: Interviews  
A3: Observation studies  
Correct: 1 
Explanation: Surveys are one of the most effective methods for gathering customer communication preferences as they provide quantitative data which can be used to gauge trends, opinions, and customer behavior. Surveys allow you to ask open-ended questions which will provide valuable insight into your customers’ preferences while also enabling you to collect large amounts of data quickly and easily. Additionally, surveys can give you invaluable information about customer demographics, such as age or gender.   
Example: A survey could be created that asks customers about their preferred method of communication (e.g., email, text message) and what times are most convenient for them to receive communications from your organization (e.g., day or night).
