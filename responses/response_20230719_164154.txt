Category: Change Management and Impact Analysis
Circumstance: You are a senior business analyst at an international technology company. Your team has just been assigned to a new project which requires developing a complex web application for the company's internal use. The project is critical in terms of time, budget, and scope. As part of their analysis process, your team must identify the potential changes that will happen due to implementing the new web application and evaluate their impact on existing systems and processes within the organization.
Q: What steps should be taken to ensure that change management is properly carried out during this project?
A1: Establish an effective communication plan between stakeholders and users throughout the entire development cycle. 
A2: Develop user training programs to help users understand how they can use the new system effectively. 
A3: Implement an audit process to monitor changes over time and identify any potential risks or pitfalls associated with them. 
Correct: 1 
Explanation: Establishing an effective communication plan between stakeholders and users is essential for successful change management as it ensures that all involved parties have access to comprehensive information about the project progress, goals, challenges etc., enabling them to communicate effectively both internally among one another as well as externally with customers or other external parties if necessary (e.g., via public relations). This helps ensure everyone stays informed about any necessary changes or updates along every step of the development process so they can quickly adapt their workflow accordingly if needed without experiencing additional delays or unexpected issues further down the line.  
Example: To ensure successful change management during this project, establish a bi-weekly meeting schedule between stakeholders representing different areas such as product design/engineering teams, marketing teams etc., where they can discuss progress reports related to various aspects of development such as specific requirements or functions being implemented in order for everyone involved in these processes (including internal staff members & customers) are up-to-date on relevant changes happening within their area of expertise during each phase of development cycle - allowing them enough time & resources needed ahead of actual implementation date(s).
