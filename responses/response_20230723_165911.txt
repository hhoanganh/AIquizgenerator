A2: Identify potential risks and assess their impact on the project’s success.

Correct: 2 
Explanation: It is critical that you identify any potential risks associated with implementing organizational change before moving forward with any other steps in the process. Defining goals, objectives, and scope can help you gain an understanding of what needs to be accomplished but does not involve analyzing or assessing risk potentials directly. Developing a plan for mitigating those identified risks should come after completing an analysis of them so that all possible scenarios can be taken into consideration when formulating your response plans.  
Example: Before taking any further action towards implementing organizational change within your organization, take some time to fully understand what underlying risks may exist by conducting research such as interviews with key stakeholders or reading industry reports related to similar initiatives undertaken by competing companies or organizations in your field. This will give you a better idea of which potential issues could arise during the implementation phase so that appropriate measures can be taken ahead of time if needed.
