Circumstance: You are a Senior Business Analyst in charge of a team that is leading an ERP implementation project for one of your clients. The client's executive board has laid out specific goals for the project and wants to ensure that it is implemented correctly. As the Senior BA, you will need to lead your team to success and mentor them along the way. 
Q: What steps should you take to ensure successful stakeholder management during the implementation?
A1: Establish clear expectations with stakeholders, communicate regularly with stakeholders throughout the development process, address any potential risks or issues early on in the project, and develop trust between all parties involved.
A2: Keep up-to-date documentation on how progress is being made against deadlines, monitor feedback from stakeholders throughout development process and use it as guidance for making decisions about product changes or features, be flexible when dealing with unforeseen problems or conflicts between stakeholders. 
A3: Monitor performance against milestones set by executives; proactively review progress reports; develop suitable communication plans for different types of stakeholders; establish trust between stakeholders through collaborative problem solving; provide regular updates on progress.

Explanation: Option A focuses too much on establishing expectations without paying enough attention to other important aspects such as monitoring performance and proactivity in addressing issues or conflicts. Option B does not focus enough attention on developing communication plans which can help prevent misunderstandings or misinterpretations due to different ideas among different types of stakeholders. Option C takes into account all aspects which need to be considered when managing stakeholder relations during an ERP implementation project; thus making it the most correct option out of three options provided in this question.
