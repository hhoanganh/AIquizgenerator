Category: Stakeholder Management and Engagement 
Circumstance: A regional bank has recently implemented a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. The implementation was filled with delays, cost overruns, and poor communication to stakeholders throughout the process. As a result, the project team is now tasked with improving stakeholder relationships before their next major initiative can start. 
Q: What should be done first to improve stakeholder relationships? 
A1: Conduct regular meetings with key stakeholders.  
A2: Develop an effective communication plan for all stakeholders. 
A3: Determine what level of influence each stakeholder holds in the organization. 
Correct: 3    
Explanation: Determining what level of influence each stakeholder holds in the organization should come first as it gives you an understanding of who needs to be engaged more heavily during any initiatives or communications that take place within or outside of your group/organization. It also provides insight into how much importance certain decision-makers have in terms of approving projects or influencing others’ decisions on behalf of your project team's goals/objectives (The Business Analysis Handbook by Howard Podeswa). Once this information is determined, then developing an effective communication plan and conducting regular meetings will help ensure everyone is informed and up-to-date on progress being made related to CRM system advancements/improvements or other changes taking place within the business organization at large (Software Requirements 3rd edition by Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty).   
Example : In order to properly manage stakeholders' expectations around a newly implemented customer relationship management (CRM) system, one must first determine which stakeholders have high levels of influence over decision making processes followed by developing an effective communication plan for all involved parties and finally engaging in periodic meetings involving key individuals who are most affected by any changes associated with said system going forward.
